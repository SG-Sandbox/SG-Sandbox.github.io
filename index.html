                <li>Contact form isn't functional yet; we'll set that up later</li>
                <li>Starting to add small animations and interactive elements</li>
                <li>I have not looked at video integration yet, let me know what video you want to display</li>
                <li>I re-did the layout in another repository, and I'll just need to combine that with this one (it makes sense trust me)</li>
                <li>Don't worry about # of revisions</li>
                <li>Gonna try to have it up before high noon<span style="font-size: .65rem;"> but I kind of suck so it might be later than that but I definetly want to update the site before evening Because it sucks to be told "you'll get thing sometime on a day" and wait all day for that thing only for it to arrive at the end of the day.</span></li>
