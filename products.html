            Our Product
The EchoBot is a translation AI robot that helps in healthcare and long-term care.

How it Works
Noticeable language barrier
Press "ON" button on EchoBot
Say phrase into robot
The speech recognition system will recognize an audio input and convert it to text
Our customized code will identify the language of input text. This utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to translate the text from source language to target language
Once translation is obtained, EchoBot uses text-to-speech (TTS) technology to convert the translated text back to spoken words
Translated speech is then outspoken through the robot's speakers
